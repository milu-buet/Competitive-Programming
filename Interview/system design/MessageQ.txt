#Messaging Models
 - Point-to-Point: One message - One consumer - once - No storage
 - Pub/Sub: One message -> topic -> Multiple consumers

 # Topic vs Queue
Queue: Sending a letter to a specific person.
Topic: Broadcasting a message on social media.


# A consumer tracks the offset of consumed messages.

Key Problems:
* What if a topic is too big for one server?
  -  we need distributed topic. A server can hold a partition/shard. Consumers can read from partition.

* What if multiple consumer reads from a single partition, then message consume order is not guraanteed. 
  - We can form consumer group, a consumer in the group can only access one partition. The consumer can track the offset in a partition.

* What if number of consumer > number of partition?
  - In that case, some consumer will never get partition assigned.
