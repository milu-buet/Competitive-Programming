Problem: Design google search auto complete feature.

Features:
1. Response time: It needs to be quick and available
2. Relevant suggestion / Contexual
3. sorted by Popularity
4. Only english


Idea steps:
1. Use Trie to search relevant answers the sort it according to popularity. O(L)
2. We can improve time: precompute and save answers for all the prefix
3. Use noSQL database/ memchached to save all the answers
4. NoSQL is appropiate
5. A mechanism is needed to update popularity hence update saved answers.
6. New keys are coming, we need more prefix entries hence update saved answers.
