➤ Core Distributed Systems & Scalability

1. How do I decide when to split a monolith into services?
2. How does a request flow end-to-end through a production system?
3. How do I design a service that can handle 10x more traffic with minimal changes?
4. What are the real trade-offs between vertical and horizontal scaling?
5. How do I choose between synchronous and asynchronous communication?
6. When should I use a queue vs direct RPC?
7. How do I design for backpressure in a high-traffic system?
8. How do I protect downstream services from traffic spikes?
9. How do I design APIs so they can evolve without breaking clients?
10. How do I handle idempotency for write APIs?

➤ Data Modeling, Storage & Indexing
11. How do I model data differently for OLTP vs OLAP workloads?
12. How do I decide between SQL, NoSQL, and search engines?
13. How do I shard data — by user, tenant, region, or something else?
14. What does a good partition key look like in a distributed store?
15. How do I avoid hot partitions and skew?
16. How should I index for read-heavy vs write-heavy workloads?

20. How do I safely backfill data in production?

➤ Caching & Performance
21. Where should I cache — client, edge, service, DB layer?
22. How do I pick between write-through, write-back, and write-around caching?
23. How do I design cache invalidation rules that don’t become a nightmare?
24. How do I handle cache stampede and thundering herd?
25. What is my caching story for hot keys and large objects?
26. How do I measure whether a cache is actually helping?
27. How do I design pagination for massive datasets efficiently?
28. How do I design rate limiting that doesn’t break good users?

➤ Consistency, Availability & Transactions
