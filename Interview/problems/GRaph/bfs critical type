#1
If I want to push and visit a node only once:

q = [node]
visited = set([node])
while q:
	node = q.popleft()

	for nbor in g[node]:
		if nbor not visited:
		   visited.add(nbor)
		   q.append(nbor)

# 2
If a node needs to be pushed multiple times and visited only once:
heap realted situation, when multiple visit is necessary

q = [(node, dist_node)]
visited = {}
whule q:
   node, dist = q.popleft() # heappop type

   if node in visited:
   		continue

   visited[node] = dist

   for nbor in g[node]:

   		q.append(nbor)


# if a node needs to be pused conditionally then
visited[node] = cost ---pattern can be used

if nbor not visited or newcost > visited[node]:
      then push
